print "#### example 02 ####"
print "this example is just a demostration of comments in python"
#to show that whatever that follows after octothorpe is taken as a comment
print "you can check the actual code to see the comments in this exercise"#this is not taken into account
#print "this is used to make python ignore some part of your code " --> this helps a lot while debugging your code.
print "#### example 03 ####"
